# Misc-Scripts-and-Challenge-Solutions

A collection of random scripts and challenge solutions I've worked on over the years.

Many of these are from during competitions or timed events so they are usually built to be functional rather than elegant; it doesnt help that some were from when I was first learning to program. I'll be going through them slowly over time and updating them.
